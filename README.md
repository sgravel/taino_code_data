# taino_code_data
This repo contains files related to paper https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24385924/ that people expressed interest in having over the years.

This publication was finished as I was starting in Genetics and before I learned proper data and software management. As a result, organization of the repository 
is not great, and software documentation is incomplete (at best). 

Not all files in this repository were generated by me. In particular, the EM method for estimating ancestral allele frequencies was coded by Fouad Zakharia. 
I am sharing them here for completeness but will not provide support for use of the method. The code contained here, lacking documentation, is likely pretty much unusable. 

Some other methods (e.g., Zhang et al, https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27153656/, https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.06.455462v1.) 
have provided methods for the same task and are likely much better documented.
